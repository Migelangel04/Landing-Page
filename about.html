                Beyond academics, I have a vibrant life outside of the classroom. Cycling has become one of my favorite hobbies, allowing me to explore new places and enjoy the freedom of the open road. 
                Weight training is another passion of mine, as it helps me stay healthy and energized. 
                And of course, I always find time for reading, as I believe continuous learning is essential for personal growth.
